            <p><em>Well...</em></p>
            <p class = intro>Juliana's opinions on totally useless things that she just so happens
            to find super important at the time of coding this website!</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Now, what does Juliana find <strong>extremely</strong> important this Wednesday afternoon?</h2>
            <p>Well, a lot of things if we're being honest. Stuff like:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Which internet cat is objectively the best?</li>
                <li>My thoughts on Cheese!</li>
                <li>And well, that's about it</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p class = centered>Unsurprisingly, my brain can't think of much more at the moment...</p>
            <p> So if you'll kindly look at this lovely <strong>ordered</strong> list for links
            to my <strong><em>objective</em></strong> and <strong><em>totally correct</em></strong> opinions down below!</p>
    
            <h3 class = centered>BEFORE YOU GO!</h3>
            <p class = centered>Please note that there's totally more to me than Cheese and Internet cats.
            This is just all I can think of at the moment! Have a lovely time!</p>
