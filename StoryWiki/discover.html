                  <p>In a world ruled by superheroes and supervillains, Clay is fortunate enough to be on the right side of history. As the face of the famous Marvelous Family, he advocates for the heroes

                    But when he's kidnapped by a higher level villain and given a mysterious note inviting him to seek out the truth, he finds himself at a crossroads. Now questioning everything he's 
                    ever been taught, Clay can't trust anyone. Even the notes he keeps finding seem to be playing mind games with him. Do the villains and notes hold the truth or has he been lied to once
                    again?<br><br>There's only one way to find out: play both sides of the game.</p>

                  <h4>Genre: Horror</h4>
                  <p>Damien isn't your normal main character. He's not lanky. He's not this benevolent dude with magical powers while somehow looking like the most handsome man on the planet. 
                  He doesn't even consider himself heroic. Heck, if he hadn't been killed by some cultists after he got lost in the woods after a Halloween party then he would continue on his way, 
                  living life as a college student still living at his parent's house.<br><br>But after being left for dead, Damien finds himself chosen by two heavenly beings and slowly turns 
                  into a creature between life and death. Now being forced to balance his mortal life and his new duties, can Damien get his revenge on those who have wronged him, or is a 
                  greater evil at play here?</p>

                  <h4>Genre: Romance</h4>
                  <p>Games.<br><br>That's all Jacob Freeman has ever really understood. He may not be able to tell you how to play football, but he can tell you how to get a critical hit 
                  or how to unlock a legendary item.<br><br>One night, he puts on his headset and gets a nasty shock from his new game, sending him in a short coma, lasting about a week. 
                  When he wakes, he is not the same person he was. He finds abilities and powers that he shouldn't be able to do in the real world.<br><br>But there are others like him who 
                  want him. Dead or alive? They don't care.<br><br>Can he survive in this dream turned nightmare?</p>
