                  <h4>Genre: Action</h4>
                  <p>In a world ruled by superheroes and supervillains, Clay is fortunate enough to be on the right side of history. As the face of the famous Marvelous Family, he advocates for the heroes 
                    and assures the public that they are fighting for justice. While he doesn't see much action, he hopes that his efforts will be noticed by the head of the Central Superhero Agency.<br><br>
                    But when he's kidnapped by a higher level villain and given a mysterious note inviting him to seek out the truth, he finds himself at a crossroads. Now questioning everything he's 
                    ever been taught, Clay can't trust anyone. Even the notes he keeps finding seem to be playing mind games with him. Do the villains and notes hold the truth or has he been lied to once
                    again?<br><br>There's only one way to find out: play both sides of the game.</p>

                  <h4>Genre: Fantasy</h4>
                  <p>In a world where anything touched by the gods are deemed to dangerous to live, Jordan was taught to never go outside the walls unless he's accompanied by a guard. 
                  As a member of the royal family, it was ingrained in him to never put his life in jeopardy when it comes to the gods.<br><br>But when a woman with purple hair summons 
                  him to a castle in the deep woods outside and touches him, he will be thrown into a world where the line between good and bad becomes blurred. What is he will to do for

                  <h4>Genre: Sci-Fi</h4>
                  <p>Mark and some friends receive early access to a new game. It's a revolutionary VR horror game that's supposed to feel realistic. However once they log in, 
                  the headset attaches to their spine and can be removed without causing permanent damage to the body.<br><br>Playing through the game, they find the strange 
                  perspective to be scarily intoxicating and euphoric. But as they progress and become more powerful, is it truly the game causing this high or is it changing their morals?</p>

                  <h4>Genre: Fantasy</h4>
                  <p>Damien isn't your normal main character. He's not lanky. He's not this benevolent dude with magical powers while somehow looking like the most handsome man on the planet. 
                  He doesn't even consider himself heroic. Heck, if he hadn't been killed by some cultists after he got lost in the woods after a Halloween party then he would continue on his way, 
                  living life as a college student still living at his parent's house.<br><br>But after being left for dead, Damien finds himself chosen by two heavenly beings and slowly turns 
                  into a creature between life and death. Now being forced to balance his mortal life and his new duties, can Damien get his revenge on those who have wronged him, or is a 
                  greater evil at play here?</p>

                  <p>Games.<br><br>That's all Jacob Freeman has ever really understood. He may not be able to tell you how to play football, but he can tell you how to get a critical hit 
                  or how to unlock a legendary item.<br><br>One night, he puts on his headset and gets a nasty shock from his new game, sending him in a short coma, lasting about a week. 
                  When he wakes, he is not the same person he was. He finds abilities and powers that he shouldn't be able to do in the real world.<br><br>But there are others like him who 
                  want him. Dead or alive? They don't care.<br><br>Can he survive in this dream turned nightmare?</p>
