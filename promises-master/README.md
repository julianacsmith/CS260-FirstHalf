# Promises

This code is adapted from [JavaScript Promises for Dummies](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-promises-for-dummies) by Jecelyn Yeen.

Each of the four buttons runs a Promise and then outputs the result. Read through the html and javascript to understand how promises work.  The [script.js](script.js) file has comments that will help you.  Copy the files to your server so you can run the javascript to understand what is happening.
